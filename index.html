            <p>My name is Leigh Dahlin and I currently reside in Sacramento, California. I grew up in Houston,
                Texas and got my bachelor's and master's degrees in Accounting at Texas A&M University in 2014.
                I worked in the accounting field for seven years when I decided that I needed a career change to
                something that I was passionate about. That's when I discovered the world of coding and all of
                the opportunites that came along with it.
                </p>
                
            <p>I started the UC Davis Coding Bootcamp in March of 2021. I have learned the basics of HTML and
                CSS and am starting to learn Javascript. UC Davis is teaching me how to work through coding
                on my own and with groups. We write code ourselves and debug code that has issues. I have 10
                hours of class a week, study at least 20 hours a week and still maintain my full-time accounting
                job while I wait to transition to my next career at the end of the bootcamp. I'm hard-working and,
                most of all, very excited and passionate about coding.
